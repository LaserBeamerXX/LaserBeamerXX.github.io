// In a real game, you would have more complex game logic and interactions.
// Here's a simplified example of a game event.

document.getElementById("complete-button").addEventListener("click", function () {
    // In this example, clicking the "Complete Mission" button just displays a message.
    alert("Mission completed! Great job!");

    // You can add more game logic here, such as updating player scores, progressing to the next level, etc.
});
